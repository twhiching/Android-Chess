This is a simple chess application developed for android phones. Functionality consists of playing chess, the ability to draw or resign the game, undoing a previously played move, having a move decide for you by the ai and being able to save a replay of the games.
All possible moves are shown to the player at all times when they select a piece. Visual feedback is given to the player when they select a move that is invalid by shaking the piece.
